--> Frontend bugs: URGENT:
- Keeping the Package Distribution list while swapping users!
- Infinite request bug when there are no packages available!

--> Share package action
    See          (addAccessPackageConfig), handleShowShare - removeSelectedPackage?! see function and fix, debug. See sharing test in backend!
--> Remove package action - full implementation
    Use the implementation of above? see related includes / imports / dependencies to not miss anything. See on the slice files if I need to add sth

--> Format logged username top-right, not just a horrible black text

--> Move footer to be always at the bottom of the screen? Package list minimum height??

--> Make home bar appear and dissappear, add uiSlice (?) to make that setting and enable and disable 

--> Footer - style as Gui is proposing

--> CaOS content fix
